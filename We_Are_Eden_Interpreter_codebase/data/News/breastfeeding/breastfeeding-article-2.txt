Council to promote breastfeeding after low rates

A borough which has the UK's lowest rate of babies whose first feed was breastmilk wants to "normalise and celebrate" breastfeeding.
Latest data shows that in the Merseyside borough of Knowsley, which also has some of the country's most deprived areas, only 43.6% of babies had a first feed of breastmilk â€“ compared to 67.4% across England.
Research within the borough found a lack of knowledge, a perception that breastfeeding in public was controversial and the sexualisation of breasts had contributed to the low rates.
Knowsley Council has now agreed to pursue a strategy to promote breastfeeding until 2030.
Councillor Christine Bannon said: "Our vision is to build a culture in which breastfeeding is normalised, celebrated and fully supported by our community.
"If we do achieve our ambition, we will have better health outcomes for children today and for generations to come."
At a council meeting last week, a report highlighted that less than a third of babies in the borough were breastfed between the ages of six to eight weeks, compared to about half of babies across England.
The NHS recommends, external babies should consume only breast milk for their first six months, with benefits including protection from illnesses and a strong emotional bond between mother and child.
Local authorities across the borough will launch a marketing campaign to promote breastfeeding.
Businesses will also be encouraged to register for a pledge to support breastfeeding, where they will be given a window sticker to indicate that mothers can breastfeed their babies in a comfortable environment.
