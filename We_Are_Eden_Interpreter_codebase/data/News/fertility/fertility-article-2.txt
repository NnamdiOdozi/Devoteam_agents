More couples eligible for funded IVF treatment

More couples will be able to access funded in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment following changes to criteria, Jersey's government has said.
Officials said the changes would come into force from 1 October and would make funded IVF treatment accessible to same-sex female couples, removing the requirement for them to prove infertility through artificial insemination.
It also means couples will be eligible for funded IVF treatment if one partner already has children, provided they do not currently have a child together.
Deputy Andy Howell, assistant minister for health and social services, with responsibility for women's health, said he was "delighted" more couples would be eligible.
Officials said eligibility for IVF funding would be based on access to funded healthcare under existing policies, ensuring long-term residents returning home to Jersey were not disadvantaged.
Howell added: "We know how deeply many couples long to have a child, and the challenges they face...is not straightforward.
"When the first round of changes to IVF funding were announced last year, I committed to keeping these under review, in a hope that we would be able to extend the offer and support more couples with IVF funding within the available budget.
"Our focus is on giving as many couples as possible the chance to build the family they dream of."
